Here are some key characteristics of a doubly linked list:\n","\n","1. Nodes: Each node in a doubly linked list contains three components:  \n","Data: The actual value or payload associated with the node.  \n","Next Pointer: A reference to the next node in the list.\n","Previous Pointer: A reference to the previous node in the list.\n","2. Head and Tail: A doubly linked list has a head node (the first node) and a tail node (the last node). The head node’s previous pointer is typically null, and the tail node’s next pointer is also null.  \n","3. Bidirectional Traversal: Unlike a singly linked list, which allows only forward traversal, a doubly linked list allows both forward and backward traversal. This bidirectional property makes it useful for certain algorithms and data manipulation tasks.  \n","4. Insertion and Deletion:  \n","Insertion: Adding a new node involves adjusting the pointers of adjacent nodes. For example, to insert a node after a given node, we update the next pointer of the given node and the previous pointer of the new node.  \n","Deletion: Removing a node requires updating the pointers of its neighbors. For instance, when deleting a node, we adjust the next pointer of the previous node and the previous pointer of the next node.
